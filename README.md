# nba-props


### Scrape up to date NBA props and convert into fanstasy points.

- Toggle settings in `params.py` for DraftKings or FanDuel, Classic or Single Game contests
- Input provided contest files from DFS sites in `data/` as `current-{site}.csv`
- Alerts to let you know what players have had props added since last run-through (initial run through will spit out large list of names)
